          When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me,
          but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I
          became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup.
          Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored
          carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe
          they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative
          for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

            When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop
            on Cambridge Avenue. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too
            adventurous on the menu -- no bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is
            fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and delicious! They have little bites
            to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's
            not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.

            I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only
            because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not
            even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I
            do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.

            Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua
            fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out
            line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny
            day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.
